# KKBOX Open API PHP SDK

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/KKBOX/OpenAPI-PHP/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/KKBOX/OpenAPI-PHP/actions)

The project helps you to access [KKBOX's Open API](https://developer.kkbox.com)
using PHP programming languages.

## Installation

You can install the package by using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```
composer require kkbox/kkboxopenapi kkbox/kkboxopenapi
```

To use the development version, please add to your `composer.json`.

```json
{
  "require": {
    "kkbox/kkboxopenapi": "dev-master"
  },
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "vcs",
      "url": "git@github.com:kkbox/OpenAPI-PHP.git"
    }
  ]
}
```

And then run `composer install`.

## Usage

### instantiation

To start using the SDK, you need to register your app in KKBOX's
[developer site](https://developer.kkbox.com) and obtain a valid
client ID and client secret. Then, you can create an instance of `OpenAPI`.

```php
use KKBOX\KKBOXOpenAPI\OpenAPI;

$clientID = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID';
$clientSecret = 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET';
$openAPI = new OpenAPI($clientID, $clientSecret);
```

### Fetch Access Token

Before doing API calls, you need to fetch an access token at first.

```php
$openAPI->fetchAndUpdateAccessToken();
```

### API Calls

When you are ready, you can make API calls like to search, or to fetch information of tracks like

```php
$response = $openAPI->search('Love');
```

The SDK adopts [Guzzle HTTP client](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle), and
the response objects conform to [PSR-7 HTTP message interfaces](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/).
So, if you want to get the JSON objects from the API response, you may
have code like

```php
$response = $openAPI->search('Love');
$searchResults = json_decode($response->getBody());
var_dump($searchResults->tracks->data);
```

## Test the Package

Just run `vendor/bin/phpunit`.
